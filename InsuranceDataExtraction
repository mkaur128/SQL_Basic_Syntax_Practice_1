#SQL Projects - Basic syntax practice
Project background:
At our insurance company, the examiners are tasked with regularly using the Reserving Tool to help them estimate how much a given claim is going to cost the company. 
There are lots of guidelines on how frequently an examiner should be using the Reserving Tool. 
An examiner has to use the reserving tool a certain number of days after the claim re-opens, after being assigned the claim, or after an examiner 
last used the Reserving Tool on that claim. Our job is to determine how long an examiner has until they are required to use the Reserving Tool, 
and if they are already past their due date, how many days they have been overdue. We will need to do this for all the claims assigned to all of our examiners. 

Objectives: 
1. The last date a claimant re-opened a claim
2. The date an examiner was assigned a claim
3. The last date an examiner published on the Reserving Tool for each claim  <br></br> 

#Query 1: The last date a claimant re-opened a claim

USE Insurance 
GO 

SELECT ClaimantID, ReopenedDate
FROM Claimant 

#Query 2: The date an examiner was assigned a claim 

SELECT PK, MAX(EntryDate) AS ExaminerAssignedDate 
FROM ClaimLog 
WHERE FileName = 'ExaminerCode' 
GROUP BY PK 

#Query 3: The last date an examiner published on the Reserving Tool for each claim

SELECT ClaimNumber, MAX(EnteredOn) AS LastSavedOn
FROM ReservingTool 
WHERE IsSaved = 1 
GROUP BY ClaimNumber
