# SQL Projects - Basic syntax practice
Project background: <br></br> 
At our insurance company, the examiners are tasked with regularly using the Reserving Tool to help them estimate how much a given claim is going to cost the company. There are lots of guidelines on how frequently an examiner should be using the Reserving Tool. An examiner has to use the reserving tool a certain number of days after the claim re-opens, after being assigned the claim, or after an examiner last used the Reserving Tool on that claim. Our job is to determine how long an examiner has until they are required to use the Reserving Tool, and if they are already past their due date, how many days they have been overdue. We will need to do this for all the claims assigned to all of our examiners.
